# DIGITAL LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main objective of this project is to provide a complete automated Library by digitizing its each and every functionality. Starting from the book-keeping, issuing of books, fine generation, advance booking and report generation all will be accomplished under one single project. The project will be a web based project with a database server responsible for maintaining every single detail of the Library. It has a very user friendly interface which can easily be operated by any non-technical person.
